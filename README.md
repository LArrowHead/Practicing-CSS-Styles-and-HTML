# Practicing-CSS-Styles-and-HTML
This code is for adding certain styles to a main document tutorial of mine for reference in later dates when coming back to css if i have to focus on other code types.

Soon There will be actual attempts at 'newsletters' explaining certain topics hopefully released on some type of forum.

#######To Do List: 

* Essay of map making for me and gameplay ideas.
* Posting the above on some type of forum.
* Creating a informational html 'letter'.
* Organize, organize, organize.





#######NOTE: This is basic css as of now, hopefully i will be making bigger and better styles!
