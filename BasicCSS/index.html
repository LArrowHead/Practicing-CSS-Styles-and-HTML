            <h2>This is a bit of a guide for myself to understand!</h2>
            
            <p>Welcome Self, This is a very light color design for paragraphs making it easy and simple to read. Organization is key and using simple yet advanced looks may help.

            <p>Using code like css and html is a good way to learn both processes at the smae time, because although different methods need done, both code forms are easy to learn.             </p>
            <h2>Organization</h2>
            <p>Having organization with programs like github for repositories, or folders                  with multiple seperation folders is a good option. Code will sometimes get                  messy and its easy to find things with most programs with file finders or                    just basic <em>open folder</em> windows.
            </p>
            <p class="note">
                An easy way to organize your code is to provide white space for yourself to                 help keep <em>tags</em> in order for yourself to easily find items in your                   code like a certain keyword.
