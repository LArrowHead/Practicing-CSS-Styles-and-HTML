{"name":"Basic Guide to Map Making Ideas and Execution.","tagline":"For Those Who Wish to Create Their Own Projects!","body":"### Beginners Map Making Idea and Execution Guide.\r\nThis is a guide to help those in need with making maps and also the pros/cons of first time map making. You can read throughout and also Contact me on Skype or other contacts at the bottom of the page. Lets Begin!\r\n\r\n### First Time Checks\r\nNow from my perspective I was always looking to make a house or something in survival that was interesting. Not everyone is the same so the best thing you can do at any given time is to start small, and build the things you know you can. Once you have that achieved you may or may not have an image of what you want you make or where to start, but don't fret, If you don't have anything to make or imagine you can always ask others or just think hard enough. If you just can't think of any ideas you may want to start fresh, and try things you wouldn't normally, you never know! Finally, if you are having trouble building in general, it is always good to mess around with different block types or styles and find out what mixes best for you. \r\n\r\n### Finding Your Style\r\nI remember myself messing around with different block types when I first tried to be a map maker. Sure it may star out slow and rough with criticism, but once you find out you love decorating, or styling, or anything, continue your efforts, because it will get to a point where you expand off that and learn the other skills you don't know so well, showing others that you can work with it. Now, If you enjoy making specific things you can start out there and move your way towards a basic map. Then, you can make any edits to it to make it look ever better to you than before, like combining different structures to make a cool looking mountain map! Anything really can be used to spark your creativity, even other maps, you just need to use your own style as well! \r\n\r\n### How To Begin \"Building\"\r\nGetting Started Building is most likely the hardest and most fun part for people since map making is exciting for most who want to pursue it. Everyone has these ideas or things they want to make but they may not know how to start out. What I do is I try to contain as much as my ideas into a model or basic outline of the map as quick as possible. From that one area you can build the rest of the map by making everything really fit together, like a puzzle. You can make a wool room area, and then fit it with the lanes leading up to it if your not comfortable making the spawn first. You can start wherever you wish, because everyone starts in a different spot than others. If you use a model of sorts you can mark off areas and get a feel for how far you are on the map, providing you with more of a vision of what it should be like, and how to expand it with the blocks you've chosen for your map.\r\n\r\n### When You Have Everything Started\r\n_When You Have Everything Started_, and your understanding what you want to do with the map, you may all of a sudden lose interest, or become drawn away from certain parts of your map or just the whole thing in general. Its fine when this happens because trust me everyone has had a loss of creativity. Start by asking someone how they feel about it or even just thinking with yourself on what could make it better. Lots of things could make you want to remove the map from this thinking as well, but you can always make edits to it that provide you with a little more understanding of what a theme or finishing layout might be. Make sure you take your time and be patient if something is frustrating you that you just can't fix. Once you get the hang of where you want to go you may run into the same problem at some point later in development of the map, but again, always work around things to try and make it better and better, you never want to fully give up on a project. \r\n\r\n### Final Notes\r\nOnce you release the map or at least are close, do your best to understand others criticism or opinions toward your map, since people have different views. Usually your first map is going to help guide you to the improvements which become less necessary as you move forward with the amount of maps you create. You never want to give up on map making unless it doesn't interest you any longer or you have an excuse to, but always try and make more maps, especially trying out different methods or plans to execute it using this guide or any other you find really useful to yourself.\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nContact my skype(larrowhead) if you have any issues or questions!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
