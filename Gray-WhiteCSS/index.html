        <h2>Take Your Time
        </h2>
        <p>
        Don't just rush through a code to get it finished, learn to take your time and make         everything great in one area before moving onto the next. It does help, especially           when learning css. Get to know some of the styles and use the ones you are                   convertable with. Learn the different pixels and how they matter to changing it.

        <h2>How I got familiar</h2>
        <p>
        Live View really helped me actually. It let me see what belonged where and i                 actually understood the css and html difference. From there i started writing               little codes like this, that gave myself something to look at later and                     understand. Soon, most likely today, i will be writing actual website code for an           informational sheet, but it may take time since i can't seem to get tables to look           nice. I'll most likely search it on the web so i can make sure i'm doing                     everything right!

        Now for me i find myself getting off track and doing other things. I will try my             best to practice this code everyday with just making a simple guide for myself. Its         kinda fun for me since i want to experiment with colors and different styles. Its           going to be fun in school if i begin to learn this stuff, since i'll know a lot. The         one thing i actually struggle with is html for the reason only of not knowing a lot         of different items to use. CSS is good because i can combine, but i hope i learn             html again in school to get a feel for more stuff!
